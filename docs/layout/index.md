# Overview
## Layout overview
House stuck to the north side of the property, people enter at the east, cars at the north, with the huge workshop door being for both workshop and garage.
The ceiling is inclined at south, with solar panels, but not at the north side, where there's an attic.
There is huge glass from floor to ceiling. Fruit trees at the south, large trees at the north.

## Trees around the property
The elevation is lower at the south of the property. Put there small deciduous fruit trees that don’t block sunlight in winter but do in summer, and never block sunlight to solar panels because they're not very tall, while the fallen leaves won’t bother since the elevation is lower and they will stay there. The house is northwards, with a wall of huge evergreen trees at the north (and west), where they never shade the solar panels and don't block useful sunlight in winter.
- Birdhouses to attract bug-eating birds, like hummingbirds or swallows. https://youtu.be/1O8J9I-AKHU











## Other
- Water storage, so it goes at the up-north of the property or house. Have a flood system to protect from fires. Since the house is at high elevation, floods won't bother it.

        Needs high place, to have passive static pressure
        Needs cold, to not spoil
