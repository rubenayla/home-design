## Workshop + Garage
- The north side of the house is placed right at the end of the property, with the garage door exposed to the road, allowing car access to the workshop and garage. Concrete or cement floor, no grass or trees.
    !!! info "Space Saving"
        There is no outside wall at the north. The house IS the wall. This lets us save space and prevents from having to go through 3 doors to get outside.
    !!! info "Noise Reduction"
        About the noise from the road, notice how the workshop separates the house from the road. It should be minimal.
    !!! info "Workshop Temperature"
        At the workshop you'll need protection. Clothing that will make you warm. There are components sensitive to too much heat. Therefore we leave the coldest place for the workshop.
- The garage door open both the workshop and garage. They are the same room, with movable separator to protect the cars.
    !!! info "Flexible Access"
        This allows to adjust for different amount of cars parked, and direct access from outside.
