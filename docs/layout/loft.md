## Main loft?
**Work place** with a **Huge table** (~90cm high, >=1x2 m) at a corner with adjustable height and bin holes, that turns around the user. It's not necessary to have height adjusting tables if you have height-adjusting chairs, unless you want a standdesk. Just have the table a bit high, and let the people adjust the relative height with the chair. I don't think that having my legs hanging is so bad.

**Pegboard** with tools separated in sections, and a **shelving wall**. *Modular? ~1.5m tall?Transparent pegboard?* Lots of **sockets** (~32 plugs) on the pegboard. Type N, and universal (C,F,G,A,B,L,J,…) sockets. Also USB-C with USB-4 standard protocol (Power Delivery), and USB-A. (A couple of HyperJuice Stackable GaN 100W chargers)

**Smart section** (likely in shelving wall) with google home max, nest hub, Alexa, smart thermostat (*Nest learning thermostat, NetAtmo…*), router, robot vacuum (Deebot Ozmo 950)
