## Bathroom

I always like warmth in the bathroom. Even in summer. Therefore I will reserve the warmest otherwise undesirable place of the house for the bathroom. South with lots of glass and sunlight. South-east for morning heat

**I change my clothes in the bathroom everyday, when I shower, so the clothes must be stored and cleaned there**. Bathroom/dressing room/cleaning room.

The **dresser, washing machine**, wet cleaning products near the washing machine (To scrub you need water, and bleach is often used in the bathroom) all inside the bathroom.

Consider direct access to the outside to hang the clothes or go to the bathroom in a hurry. Should be secure.

The bathroom must have **ventilation** (HVAC in addition to a window) and the closet may have a ~curtain to keep it completely dry. Wet clothes will dry there. I have tested it and my clothes are perfect in the bathroom.

A **mirror wall**, glass wall, and **marble (carrara) or pallet floor** that does not slip, + white ceramic tiles, marble or wood for the rest.

Imagine the door, a side of the bathroom accessible first (opposite to the door hinge) is where the WC must be, so you can get there quickly and open the door while sitting. The sink next to the WC, have somewhere to put stuff while in the WC. Then the shower goes at the free corner that shares a side with the sink. That side is the "wet" side of the bathroom. Washing machine anywhere that doesn't bother.

- Shower
    - Electric shower with fixed water outlet from the ceiling and a water outlet with handle that can be placed in a hanger like a normal tap, with control for the water flow and temperature (*with thermometer?*). With soap dispensers (shampoo, gel, cream). The drain at one border of the floor.
    - One side of the shower is a mirror. Use the shower to wash teeth, shave, exfoliate, apply creams and stuff... In that way it's easy to clean everything. Lots of storage for products. Put the sink in the shower? All the floor ends up wet so it's not such a problem.
    - Towels stored right beside the shower.
- Dresser
    - Tall modular (Brickbox) shelving with hangers in its vertical structure. (Generally, try to use shelvings rather than drawers)
    - Shoes, crocs, socks... at the bottom. Pants, shorts and swimsuits above. T-shirts and sweatshirts at shoulder height. Scarfs, hats, and gloves higher.
    - Many hangers for jacket and others.
    - All clothes, clean and dirty, cleaning products, spare shampoo, gel, soap, bleach, detergent... Very big
    - **Toilet** with central jet to clean (normal or smart. joystick or electronic), without external bidet nor bathtub.
