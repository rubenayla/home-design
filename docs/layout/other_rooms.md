## Desk room
The layout will be a big table that goes around you in the shape of U, one side of the U against the wall, the other free to the room, so you could sit with other people in conversation.

## Play room (Living room)
Games, TV, couch, place for reading (light, socket, carpet, shelving with books)

Probably floor -1, since it's dark and easily isolated from the rest of the house. Good for films, and close to the kitchen.

## Bunker craziness
would go in floor -2 if I were to add it.

## Reading zone
Either room or cozy zone to chill, read close to a window in a sofa

## Instrument room
Piano in room probably at south-west of floor 1.

Soundproof etc.
Might use this as guest room too.
