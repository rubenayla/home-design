## Kitchen
**American kitchen** with a tall **island table**.

windows that don’t hinder when opened (high or sliding)

Raised dishwasher right by the island table, in the other side of the narrow passage formed with the counter.

Optional sliding glass doors with rail on the ceiling, continuous floor (no mess cleaning the rail and ok for vacuum robot)

Double Tank sink discarded, just have a large one, you can add accessories later. Ok for big stuff.

Diamond shape cabinet on the corner of the wall

### Island table
- with the sink
- water tap (to fill glasses of water directly on the spot and clean the dishware next to where it's used)
- trash bins (consider a trash can drawer, next to the table)
- tall stools
- Should be able to sit on all sides of the island table, with tall backless 3-legged stools. Consider the required overhang to not hit the table with the knees (~>= 38cm), and at least 60cm of space per person. Can use hidden island countertop brackets. 

### Hanging shelving
- Over the island table
- Dispenser
    - Salt, pepper, oil, vinegar
    - Paper dispensers (normal kitchen paper, plastic, aluminum)
- Storage over the sink for dishware and silverware, so it can dry and be stored in the same place, dripping over the sink.
- Also store pans and pots, rags
- sockets, free space, and the light bulbs right over the table.

### Countertop
At the corner of the countertop is the **induction hob**, and a cooking robot nearby (to cut, heat, weigh, measure temperature, program foods...), with stainless steel pans. From the corner it's much easier to absorb the fumes of the cooking, and the person cooking hinders less there (the fumes go through the wall outside without bothering solar panels). Also the cooking mess won’t dirty the eating table. Wall has to be of clean material there (tiles, stainless steel, or glass splashbacks).

The external countertop accessible from the outside when the window/wall is opened.

### Big shelving
With all the food storage (open shelving or just a cloth to keep clean of dust and grease) next to the fridge (same purpose as shelving, just cold) which is at the north (coldest place). It must be deep to store all the food there. Transparent plastic boxes as drawers. Consider a dedicated beverage fridge (not freestanding, with vents). Cabinets up to the ceiling for + space and - dust acumullation.
