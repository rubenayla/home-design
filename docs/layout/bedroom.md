## Bedroom
Tiny, simple, relaxing and cozy bedroom, with tatami and futon. Elevated platform or small room with carpet tiles, windows, smart bulbs.
!!! warning "Bedroom Placement"
    This must NOT be part of the loft. There are lots of things that might make noises or lights during the night. Better separate tiny room

Oriented at east, without street lights, so that you can wake up with the sunrise (if you want).
