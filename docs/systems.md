# Water
Take the water from the rain, filter it, and store it clean. This allows us to add water with a truck in case of drought.

Drinking water, grey water, and dirty water will be separate.

Make some hump at the lower part of the property to keep rainwater and make it filter into the ground.

## Heating

The house will have no gas, so there must be a system to heat the water with electricity (or solar energy).

1. Investigate taps that can warm water instantly, without a boiler. This would provide hot water instantly, without wasting water.
2. Investigate an electric boiler with heat pump. This lets the use of electricity when it is cheapest and most abundant.


# HVAC - Temp of air
The system will use first all the natural resources available, opening and closing windows, curtains, etc. Then, it will use the heat pump to get the perfect temperature.

The workshop needs good air circulation, so it will use electric radiant or infrared panel heaters.

Ventilation from window at west to the attic (chimney effect), kitchen and bathroom.

!!! note "Discarded"
    - Heated floor
        - A simple heat pump (split) should be more than enough

!!! info "Heat exchanger"
    A heat exchanger (or recuperator) will continuously keep the air fresh, and eliminates the need to ventilate the house and then warm it up again. This saves energy while improving air quality.

    Can be done with rotary heat exchangers, or ducted plate.

!!! tip "Actuated windows"
    To ventilate faster and automatically, for example in summer nights, to keep the house cool with 0 energy, at least 2 windows in opposite sides of the house will have an actuator to open and close automatically.

!!! warning "Insulation and thermal mass"
    **Big thermal mass inside. The house and hot water of the tank can be heated/cooled when power is cheapest or more abundant, and the heat stored for later.**

    - The thermal mass will shift the warm part of the day towards the afternoon.
    - If you ventilate the house when it's cold, thermal mass will bake it more expensive to warm up again. The house should remain sealed if undesired temps.
    - Methods to increase thermal mass: slabs, water, water wallâ€¦
    - In summer, you could ventilate at night and keep the house cool all day
    - In winter, you could heat at noon, when the solar panels are at full power and the outside air is warmest (so the heat pump takes less energy)
