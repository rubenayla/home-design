Even if we end up renting one, it\u2019s still expensive, and affects our mood and productivity.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a home design that makes me productive with the least possible effort, and does not hinder with useless stuff. I want simplicity, but not limitations. Design to not have problems. Minimum maintenance.</p> <p>Minimalism. Reduce the amount of stuff. Have only a few quality electronic products with USB-C charging ports. Even remove potentially useful things that I use so rarely that when I need them, I don\u2019t know where they are or even remember that I have them. Consider how to remove keys.</p> <p>I like to build and design things, so I will add a workshop.</p> <p>I don't want to have to water the plants by design. I'll do it if I want, but the house has to be nice without me having to be physically there and remember that responsibility. The little watering must be automatic. Most plants should be in the ground, like in a forest, with natural mycelium networks connecting them together, not in pots.</p> <p>The house must withstand the roots of the trees. How to do it?

Some paraffin waxes could stabilize 23\u00baC with prefab homes. Be careful to use it in a house with a constant desired temperature. If the house is manually ventilated with undesired air temperatures, or the user wants high temperature changes, it can increase the energy consumption (obviously). For example: In the summer cool the tank at night with the exterior radiator, and at daytime let the heat pump use the water tank instead of the exterior hot air to cool the house.
