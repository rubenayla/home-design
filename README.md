# Home Design

This repository contains the documentation for my home design project. The documentation is built using MkDocs.

# MKDocs

## âœ… Preview locally

```bash
poetry run mkdocs serve
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
```

Or use a specific port:

```bash
poetry run mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8001
```

To build the static site:

```bash
poetry run mkdocs build
# Output: site/
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
poetry run mkdocs gh-deploy
```

> GitHub Pages must be enabled in the repo settings (branch: `gh-pages`).

## ðŸ“Ÿ PDF Export (optional)

PDF export is disabled by default to speed up builds. To export PDFs explicitly:

```bash
EXPORT_PDF=true poetry run mkdocs build
# Outputs: site/pdf/kart-documentation.pdf
```

## ðŸ—‚ Branch structure

Do all edits on `main`.
