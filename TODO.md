- kitchen unload dishwasher with 0 steps, no need to move. drawers with holders maybe, or just the over-kitchen thing.

1. Create a Central Glossary

  You have a good list of acronyms in reference.md. As the project grows, you'll likely have more specialized terms. I suggest creating a dedicated glossary.md page.
  This would provide a single, easy-to-find place for all definitions, keeping your other documents cleaner and more focused on their main topic.


- GYM goes at -1, stable temperature and free space for leisure and noise. Could go elsewhere though.

- All the cables and tubing exposed, like a garage tray. Easy maintenance and modification
- Corners seem annoying, but they're the ideal places for tables. Triangle or curvy shaped, go around you.
- Close the kitchen? separate room or some glass, to isolate smoke and noise. But eat there, so keep big.
- Underground pipe for thermal mass? T is constant about 1m below surface.

- Si vamos a poner una valla alrededor de la casa, 
- If we're going to put a fence around the house, the house should be part of the fence (part of the perimeter), so we save an extra door to have to open everyday, we save time, and also that space and extra brick. You can look at USA houses with no fence, norway ones where the fence turns inside creating an exposed entrance zone, so the house is not so close to the street, or just make it right there. In cities buildings are huge and it's no problem.
